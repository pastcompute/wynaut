## Image information data set - data conversion process

* There are 80000 records in the CSV. Thats 30 megabytes...
* The second generation, if we have time on Sunday, can have an API on a VPS to speed up loading
* But to start with, I've pulled out 500 records and manually converted to JSON so we can prove the web page design first.
* Manual conversion via http://www.csvjson.com/csv2json
